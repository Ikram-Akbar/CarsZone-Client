 **CAR ZONE project based on MERN stack.** 
*MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It is a full-stack JavaScript solution that helps you build fast, robust, and maintainable web applications using MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the web framework, React.js as the front-end framework, and Node.js as the back-end runtime environment*

*React for the frontend with React Bootstrap and in the backend using Node.js and Express.js.  MongoDB as a database. You can perform **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) on data using this stack*

 - This app uses **React JS** as the main technology for building the user interface.
- It also uses **React-Router-dom** for managing the navigation and routing of the app.
- For styling and layout, it uses **React-Bootstrap** popular libraries that provide ready-made components and themes.
- To handle forms and validation, it uses **React hook form**, a lightweight and performant library that works with native HTML inputs.
- To add some animation and transition effects, it uses **React Reveal**, a library that offers easy-to-use components for revealing and hiding elements.
- The app is user friendly and **responsive**, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
- The app has **an admin panel** where the admin can make or change anything in the app, such as products, categories, orders, etc.
- The admin can also create or assign different roles for the website, such as manager, editor, customer service, etc.
- The customer or user can buy products from the app using a secure payment system.
